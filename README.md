*Film Viet Australia — Competitive Analysis of Indian Films (2025)*

---

## 🎬 Purpose

**Masalytics** helps **Film Viet Australia** understand how Indian films perform in Australia — so we can make smarter decisions when scheduling and marketing Vietnamese releases.

Indian cinema is one of our biggest competitors for screens, marketing attention, and international audiences.
This project tracks **Indian film releases in 2025** to benchmark:

* 📈 **Box-office performance**
* 🗓️ **Release timing & competition windows**
* 🏢 **Distributor activity & reach in Australia**
* 📍 **Location-level demand** (state / cinema chains)

The goal: **protect screening slots, optimise release dates, and refine marketing spend** for Vietnamese titles.
